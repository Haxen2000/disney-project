# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The src folder was emptied (minus index.js) after re-reading the requirements, so that I could continue to use *npm start* to run locally while working in the public folder with vanilla JS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` & `npm run build`

I do not have any tests set up, and building will overwrite the public folder.

***DO NOT RUN THESE***
